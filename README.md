Restaurants to the MAXX!, is a group project created by Darryl Dixon, Shariff Rudolph, and Kimberly McCaffrey (coworkers for MAXX Potential).  A common topic of workplace conversation is "Where should we eat?".  That question was the origin for our group project.  This project will gather restaurants that are local to the MAXX Potential - Norfolk, VA office.  



As a result, coworkers will be able to access their dining options more easily. This will increase both efficiency and morale in the workplace.
