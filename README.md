Restaurants to the MAXX!, is a  webpage & group project created by Darryl Dixon, Shariff Rudolph, and Kimberly McCaffrey.  We work for MAXX Potential, and a common topic of conversation is "Where should we eat?".  This was the origin of the idea for our group project.  Our project will gather restaurants that are local to the MAXX-Norfolk, VA office.  This collection will make it easier for coworkers to determine where to eat.
